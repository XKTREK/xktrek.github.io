My name is **Jue Hou (侯爵)**, which means "**Marquis**" in English. I am currently a master student at <a href='https://www.xmu.edu.cn/'>Xiamen University <img src='./images/title/XMU.png' style="height: 1em;"></a>, where I am advised by [Prof. Jinsong Su (苏劲松)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w6qCk3sAAAAJ). I received the bachelor's degree from <a href='https://www.swufe.edu.cn/'>Southwestern University of Finance and Economics <img src='./images/title/SWUFE.png' style="height: 1em;"></a> in 2025.
